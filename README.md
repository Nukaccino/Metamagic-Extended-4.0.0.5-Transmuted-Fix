# Baldur's Gate 3 - Metamagic Extended 4.0.0.5 Transmuted Fix

ALL CREDITS GOES TO ORIGINAL AUTHOR [darkcharl](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/users/31476305)!

This is temporary fix for [Metamagic Extended](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/405) version 4.0.0.5.

In 4.0.0.5 version, transmuted spell is toggled off immediatly after choose elemental type. This happens because those are share same `StackID` value.

**I will remove this repository as soon as author upload fix!**
